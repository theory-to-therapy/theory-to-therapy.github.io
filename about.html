      <h1>About the Conference</h1>
      
      <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Next Frontier in Medical Data 2026 is a one-day colloquium that brings together leading researchers from mathematics, physics, statistics, and medical sciences to explore innovative interdisciplinary approaches to healthcare data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          As healthcare systems worldwide generate unprecedented volumes of complex data—from genomic sequences to medical imaging to electronic health records—there is an urgent need for sophisticated analytical methods. This conference showcases how techniques from mathematical modeling, statistical inference, machine learning, and computational physics are driving breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment optimization, and drug discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to foster collaboration between theoretical researchers and clinical practitioners, creating pathways for mathematical innovation to achieve therapeutic impact. The colloquium provides a platform for knowledge exchange, networking, and identifying new research opportunities at the interface of physical sciences and medicine.
